As the man page above describes, this is a silly tool for resorting your firefox bookmarks
via the backup json dump.

Basically it sorts the bookmarks by the visual length (proportional) of the
bookmark title, (if failing that, the url) then by the content of the
title/url.

It has a couple of basic rules:
	* Honor the bookmark separator bars, IE anything before or after a
		separator bar will always be before or after.
	* Sort the Folders first.
	* Finally the actual bookmarks will be sorted.
